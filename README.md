# qMNase-seq
This repo contains custom MATLAB and R scripts used for analyzing quantitative MNase-seq data.

The raw data used in our qMNase-seq paper have been deposited in the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under the accession number GSE128689.

To run these scripts create a directory tree consisting of 2 folders: data and scripts, and copy all the folders containing individual processing steps into the scripts folder. The sequencing data files (BAM files) need to be copied into the data folder.
